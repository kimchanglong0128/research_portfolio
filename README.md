# 🏫 CHANGLONG JIN

Hi, I'm **CHANGLONG JIN**, currently pursuing an Integrated Master–Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at **Yonsei University**.  
My research aims to develop **generative models with stronger inductive biases**, enabling them to maintain semantic consistency, preserve identity, and continuously self-improve through multimodal feedback.

I am particularly interested in:
- score-based generative modeling  
- multimodal alignment and consistency  
- self-refining generative systems  
- parameter-efficient adaptation (LoRA, Adapters)

# 🔬 Current Research Directions

## 🧩 Proposal 1 — Identity-Preserving Diffusion Dynamics
One-shot personalization often suffers from identity drift in diffusion models.  
I investigate **how identity information propagates through diffusion SDE/ODE fields**, and develop:

- low-rank and structure-aware inductive biases for identity preservation  
- identity-stable probability-flow ODE formulations  
- dynamics-level controls for stabilizing identity across timesteps  

**Goal:** A theoretically grounded, identity-stable personalization framework under minimal samples.

## 🔁 Proposal 2 — Closed-Loop Multimodal Alignment
Current text-to-image models lack mechanisms for **self-evaluation and self-correction**.  
I propose a **closed-loop T2I ↔ I2T alignment framework** using:

- CLIP- and caption-based multimodal rewards  
- iterative cycle consistency to reduce semantic drift  
- lightweight adapter-based continuous refinement  

**Goal:** A self-improving multimodal generative system with robust alignment, especially for long-tail or compositional prompts.

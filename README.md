# 🏫 CHANGLONG JIN — AI Integrated Master–Ph.D. 

I am an Integrated Master–Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at Yonsei University.  
My research focuses on making generative models **more stable, faithful, and self-correcting**, with a particular emphasis on diffusion models and multimodal alignment.

Research Interests:
- **Dynamics-aware Diffusion Models**
- **Closed-loop Multimodal Alignment**
- **PEFT & AST**
- **Inductive Bias**

Overall, my goal is to design generative systems that not only produce high-quality images, but also **know when they are wrong and learn how to fix themselves.**

# 🎯 Research Focus


- **Understanding and shaping inductive biases** that gshape identity and semantic representations and influence their stability during diffusion. [**part I**]
- **Modeling personalization as a perturbation to diffusion dynamics**, identifying unstable or drift-prone directions, and designing mechanisms for identity-stable sampling. [**part I**]
- **Building closed-loop multimodal alignment systems** where text–image models use semantic feedback to evaluate and refine their own outputs. [**part II**]

# 🔬 Unified Research Agenda  
## Designing Reliable, Dynamics-Aware, and Self-Correcting Generative Models

My research explores how **inductive biases**, **diffusion dynamics**, and **multimodal feedback** shape the reliability of modern generative models.  
I focus on two complementary directions:

1. **Dynamic Control of Drift-Prone Directions in Personalized Diffusion Models**  
   Modeling personalization as a perturbation to the pretrained score field, identifying drift-prone directions, and developing dynamic control mechanisms to preserve identity stability.

2. **Closed-Loop Multimodal Alignment for Text–Image Generation**  
   Enabling text–image generative models to evaluate and refine their outputs using CLIP and caption-based semantic feedback, leading to self-correcting generation pipelines.

Together, these projects aim to establish a unified framework for generative models that maintain identity, preserve semantic consistency, and continually improve through multimodal signals.
